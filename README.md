# SerialPort-Commutation
Serialport communication user interface for motor_control which could implementation data visualization.
Implemented a serialport communication with TI's DSP TMS28035 as a host software for motorcontrol.
All code is programed with c#,and consist of a couple of function modules.
This UI could select the different running mode of a PMSM motor ,and the real-time data such as torque,Angle and speed of the motor are all
avaliable to be visualized in a Chart which could help user to better understand the rule of a motor.
